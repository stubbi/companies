# Financial Services

11-agent finance company — coverage, research, fund admin, and onboarding, with a CEO that handles intake and cross-team coordination. Ported from anthropics/financial-services into the Agent Companies format.

## Boundaries

Nothing in this package constitutes investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.
These agents draft analyst work product (models, memos, research notes,
reconciliations) for review by a qualified professional. They do not make
investment recommendations, execute transactions, bind risk, post to a ledger,
or approve onboarding; every output is staged for human sign-off.

## Teams

- **Coverage & Advisory** (`teams/coverage-advisory/TEAM.md`) — Client-facing pitch and meeting workflows.
- **Research & Modeling** (`teams/research-modeling/TEAM.md`) — Sector research, earnings, and live financial modeling in Excel.
- **Fund Admin & Finance Ops** (`teams/fund-admin-finance-ops/TEAM.md`) — Valuation, close, and statement workflows for fund administrators.
- **Operations & Onboarding** (`teams/operations-onboarding/TEAM.md`) — KYC and client onboarding workflows.
